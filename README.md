###iOS Client for the popular, accessible encrypted chat platform.
Cryptocat is an experimental chat client for easy to use, encrypted conversations. It aims to make encrypted, private chat easy to use and accessible. We want to break down the barrier that prevents the general public from having an accessible privacy alternative that they already know how to use. It uses the [OTR](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/) protocol over XMPP for encrypted two-party chat and the (upcoming) mpOTR protocol for encrypted multi-party chat.

##Experimental Status
Cryptocat is still under development. Only use it for experimentation! We've had quite a few serious bugs in the past couple of years. [Reports are available on our blog](https://blog.crypto.cat/category/security/).

##Used Frameworks
- [TBMultipartyProtocolManager](https://github.com/tbalthazar/TBMultipartyProtocolManager) for multiparty encrypted chat
- [TBOTRManager](https://github.com/tbalthazar/TBOTRManager) for OTR
